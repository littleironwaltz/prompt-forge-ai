## Purpose

This system provides a comprehensive framework for creating optimized prompts for AI image generation, ensuring:
- High-quality image output that accurately reflects user intent
- Structured and reproducible prompt generation process
- Efficient generation workflow with built-in quality management
- Emotional resonance optimization and control

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Meta Prompt Generation**
   - Input Analysis
     - Morphological and syntax analysis
     - Semantic consistency checking
     - Contextual compatibility verification
   - Emotion Intensity System
     - Subtle (0.25): gentle, soft modifiers
     - Moderate (0.50): balanced, natural modifiers
     - Strong (0.75): intense, dramatic modifiers
     - Extreme (1.0): maximum, overwhelming modifiers
   - Advanced Analysis
     - Visual element and style analysis
     - Technical constraint evaluation

2. **Prompt Construction**
   - Core Elements
     - Main subject definition (required: description, emotional state, intensity)
     - Environment settings (required: background, lighting mood)
     - Style specifications
   - Emotion Mapping System
     - Joy (warm tones, upward composition)
     - Serenity (cool tones, horizontal balance)
     - Drama (contrast, diagonal movement)
     - Melancholy (muted colors, descending composition)
   - Validation checks

3. **Quality Management**
   - Syntax and semantic verification
   - Error pattern handling
   - Comprehensive feedback system
   - Quality metrics monitoring
   - Emotional coherence validation

## Technical Specifications

## Prompt Structure

### Required Elements

1. **Main Element Definition**
   - Subject details
   - Emotional state and intensity
   - Pose/angle specification
   - Position information

2. **Environment Settings**
   - Background description
   - Light source configuration
   - Weather conditions (optional)
   - Time setting (optional)

3. **Style Specification**
   - Art style definition
   - Emotional intensity level
   - Rendering quality parameters
   - Technical modifiers

## Security & Compliance

- Content safety filtering
- Privacy protection measures
- Copyright compliance verification
- Ethical standards enforcement

## Implementation Guide

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```
   1. Define main subject with detailed attributes and emotional state
   2. Set emotional intensity level
   3. Add environmental elements progressively
   4. Apply style modifiers and technical parameters
   ```

2. **Optimization Process**
   - Engine-specific customization
   - Style preference adaptation
   - Generation efficiency tuning
   - Emotional resonance fine-tuning

## Best Practices

- Maintain balance between detail and conciseness
- Ensure visual consistency across elements
- Regular optimization based on generation results
- Validate all required elements before submission
- Match emotional intensity across all prompt components

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Prompts
```
Input: "happy scene, strong"
Output: "vibrant sunny scene, intense joyful atmosphere, dynamic upward composition, warm color palette"

Input: "peaceful landscape, subtle"
Output: "gentle misty landscape, soft serene atmosphere, minimal horizontal composition, soft cool tones"
```

### Style Variations
```
Base: "portrait, dramatic, extreme"
Variations:
- "portrait with maximum contrast, overwhelming dramatic atmosphere, extreme perspective, deep shadows"
- "portrait in intense lighting, powerful emotional impact, dynamic angular composition"
```

## Important Notes

- Always verify prompt length compliance
- Ensure complete description of required elements
- Maintain clear style specifications
- Monitor and incorporate generation feedback
- Verify emotional consistency across elements

## Continuous Improvement

The system includes built-in feedback mechanisms for:
- Visual quality assessment
- Technical performance monitoring
- User intent matching verification
- Style consistency evaluation
- Emotional resonance measurement

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure your submissions:
- Follow the established prompt structure
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Pass all quality verification checks
- Comply with security and ethical guidelines
- Maintain emotional coherence standards
